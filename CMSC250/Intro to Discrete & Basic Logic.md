##### Definition of Discrete
A #Discrete structure is defined as a structure in which the elements are "separated" from each other in some way
Example: Real numbers are continuous, integers are discrete
Rational numbers are neither continuous nor discrete, they have gaps within them but parts of the set is also discrete-> it's weird. 
### Propositional Logic
Contains principles of reasoning focusing on structure of proposition and methods of valid deduction 
##### Statements/Proposition
What is a #Statement versus a #Proposition ?
A statement has to be either true or false. Variables can be used such as $p$ or $q$ to represent T/F values. 
"Pineapples are yellow" & "Ice is hot", they can be true or false as long as it is defined which one it is. 
However, a statement can exist even if whether it is true or false is unknown. For example: $p \land q$ can be true or false depending on the values of $p$ and $q$, but it is still a statement. On the other hand, "I will get into a car crash tomorrow" is not a statement. I might get into one, but I also might not. It is uncertain. 
Note that statements cannot change depending on the instance or environment. 
"I like mangoes": Depending on who "I" am, the sentence could be true or false -> it is defined by the instance. 
Furthermore, if there is an undefined variable, it is also not a statement. 
##### Logical Connectives

| Symbol  | Casual | Formal      |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| $\land$ | And    | Conjunction |
| $\lor$  | Or     | Disjunction |
| $\neg$  | Nor    | Negation    |
Statements can be joined together to form more complex statements(Note that $p$ by itself can be a standalone statement as well). 
###### Rules of Precedence:
$\neg$ has precedence over $\land$ and $\lor$, whereas $\land$ and $\lor$ have the same precedence. 
Parenthesis are important, note that $p \land q \land r$ is a statement whereas $p \land q \lor r$ is not. 
Generally, parenthesis are necessary if the order in which the statement is calculated makes a difference. 
### Predicate Logic
Be able to convert English into #Predicate logic. 
"Either Sue is tired or Sue is hungry" -> $h \lor t$ where $h$ = Sue is hungry and $t$ = Sue is tired. 
#### Interpretations
An interpretation of a predicate statement is where we set values to all of the predicates($p$, $q$, etc.). 
For the situation above, one possible interpretation would be that
