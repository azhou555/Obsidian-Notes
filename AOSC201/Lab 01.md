Prefixes for clouds:
Cirro - high level
Alto - mid level
Nimbo - rain, involves precipitation
Visibility -> statute miles(SM) or miles 
**Isobars**
- Lines of equal pressure
- Tightly packed isobars indicate strong weather system and strong winds, large pressure gradient
**Isotherms**
- Lines of equal temperature
- Fronts occur where isotherms are packed together, large temperature gradient
- Circle is a warm front, triangle is a cold front
When making isobar or isotherm maps, lines connect places of the same pressure or temperature, constant values.
