Shadowing is when a subclass attempts to override an instance variable declared in the superclass. NOT RECOMMENDED
State refers to the attributes of the object. .equals works when objects share the same state -> All their attributes are the same. Multiple inheritance is disallowed because two methods can be a subclass of a superclass and override the same method-> which one should the sub sub class inherit?
Use composition if polymorphism is unneeded.
