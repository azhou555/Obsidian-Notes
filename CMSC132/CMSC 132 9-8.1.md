When taking in a parameter, it is best to set the instance variables to a copy of the passed object rather than the object itself. Likewise, in a getter it is better to return a copy of the object -> new String(string) rather than the object itself.
Polymorphism: a single object can act as multiple different things. If the class Student extends class Person, any method with the parameter will also be able to take in an object of Student class, because the object can act as a Person.Â  If no empty constructor() is called, java will implicitly call an empty constructor(). super() constructor is implicitly called. However, if no super() is defined, there will be a compile error. super() allows subclass to bypass privacy policies
