![[(MSC 132 9-8.jpeg]]
Overriding a method must return the same or more specific instance of the superclass method, and can be equal or more public
Upcasting is always done, and is also done implicitly by java:
```
Student s = new Student();
Person p = (Person) s;
Person p = s;
Both are equivalent, the (Student) is redundant
```
Downcasting only works when the object being downcast is of the type they are being downcast to. For example,
```
Person p = new Student():
Student s = (Student) p;
```
If some person is of type Student, then the code will run. Otherwise, ClassCastException
Note: Compiler only observes the type of variable
Safe downcasting:
```
if (p instanceOf Student){
    Student s = (Student)p;
}
```
Checks if p is an instance of Student, and if so attempts to downcast.
