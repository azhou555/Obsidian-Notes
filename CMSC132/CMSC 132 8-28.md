Interfaces can have static methods, they don't have instance variables, and they also don't have constructors because they don't have any instance variables they need to define in a constructor.
Override works when subclass and superclass both have the same method. An overload won't compile if its not overriding a method in the super class, and the type of the variable is that of the superclass.
