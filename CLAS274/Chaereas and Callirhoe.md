Set in Syracuse, Sicily

- First plan fails miserably, as neither person doubts the other for long, regardless of what evidence may suggest
Chaereas greatly regrets killing Callirhoe, and begs for the people to stone him to death, to kill him in "unimaginable ways" in order to make him repent for what he had done. 
It is very obvious that class hierarchies play a large role in society. The lives of the servants, of commoners, and anybody not of noble status seems to be worth almost nothing. 
Polycharmus, Chaereas' friend, refuses to et him die, although Chaereas himself desperately wishes so. 
Theron desired to get rich from the gold and valuables that would be sent off with Callirhoes casket(?)
Plangon is still a slave, whose allegiances are only to herself and to her husband. Upon being told that she would be freed if she could convince Callirhoe to marry Dionysius. 
Dionysius is rich and grieving his late wife. He is described as all to be an honorable man who pays respects to the gods, and feels a duty to do the right thing even if it doesn't align with his own interests. However, he is so infatuated with Callirhoe that he is willing to use underhanded methods in order to convince her to marry him.
