# Tides
Two high tides and two low tides every day: semidiurnal lunar cycle. When the moon is really far away + when the moon is really close, the difference in gravitation pull creates extra strong tidal waves. Waves are caused by gravity. The gravitational pull goes towards the moon on the lunar side of earth, and opposite the moon on the other side. Thus, the waves are always pulsing away from the hemisphere split thingy. 

We generally have semidiurnal, diurnal, and long period tidal constituents. For semidiurnal and diurnal, they both have constituents from the sun and the moon. The moon one is generally slightly longer( around half an hour and 1 and a half hours difference). 
Note that the gravitational pull of the tides is never going to be straight up or straight down. Instead, there will be a horizontal tilt of some degree. 
Gravitational force is directly proportional to the mass of the two objects(object exerting force and observed object), and inversely proportional to the distance between the two objects. 
Lunar tides are larger in comparison to their solar counterpart. The smallest tides are those from "Other" planetary bodies. Specifically, this usually refers to Jupiter(Largest effect). 
Tides also have different amplitudes depending on the region. Strongest tides are off the west coast of Canada near Alaska. 
# Wind waves/Tsunamis
## Wind Waves
Wavelength
	1. L
	2. length from crest to next trough
2. Water depth
	1. H
Three types of SGW:
c = speed of wave
1. Capillary
	1. L = 1 cm
	2. c ~ $(1/L)^{1/2}$
	3. Greater the L, slower the wave
2. Deep water waves
	1. L << H
	2. c = $(gL/(2pi))^{1/2}$
	3. Greater the L, the faster the wave
3. Shallow water waves
	1. L > H
	2. c = $(gH)^{1/2}$ m/s (speed)
	3. Speed doesn't depend on L
Waves approaching a beach:
1. Slow down (shallow water waves get slower as H decreases)
2. Bunch up
3. Increase in amplitude
We can describe wind waves in different categories:
 - Calm
 - 2-5 m/s
 - 6-10 m/s
 - Gale Force: 17-24 m/s
 - Hurricane:
	 - Cat1: 33 m/s
	 - Cat5: 70 m/s
Waves approaching a beach get closer together and increase in amplitude.
Speed decreases, wavelength decreases, height decreases, but amplitude increases. Period stays the same. 
Note that period is a measurement of *TIME*. 
Swells are long period waves that are caused by distant storms. 
## Tsunamis
Tsunamis are shallow surface water waves that are generated by earthquakes. When the sea floor is lifted, it generates a wave. 
# Shorelines
## Erosion
Wind waves, tides, etc. contain kinetic energy. All that energy is dissipated when the waves make contact with the shoreline. As a result, we get erosion.  Erosion vs. deposition vs. transportation is determined by the size of the particle and the speed of the current.

Note in the graph above that some grains are too small to be deposited. Also note that the larger the grain, the less likely it is that the grain will simply be transported along the coast. During summer, weaker winds and less frequent storms lead to more deposition. This causes shorelines to *grow*. On the other hand, during winter the winds pick up again and storms increase in frequency. This results in increased erosion rates. This is a cycle. 
## Cliffed
Hard rock cliff standing well above the water. Occurs relatively frequently in Maryland and Delaware, as well as California coasts and Ireland. 
## Alluvial/Eroding
Easily eroded coastlines. Close to sea level. Eastern shore Maryland. Surround coral islands in the tropics. 
## Depositional
Slow currents result in high rates of deposition. This creates a depositional coastline. 

When around headlands, the water will erode at the sides of the headland and deposit sediment at the cove. Right next to the coast, sediment is always transported southward. Of the coast, in Atlantic Ocean it goes northward and in Pacific Ocean it goes southward. 
Jetties jut out from the shoreline, and catch sediment that is being transported along the coast by interfering with the alongshore transport of sand. Their intent is to artificially create or extend a depositional coastline. Results in deposition on its upstream side, but more erosion on its downstream side. 

Coastal buffers are designed to protect coastlines from erosion. Natural coastlines are simulated in order to prevent erosion. Creating a shoreline out of rocks/stones is a common way of doing this->rock erodes slower than dirt. The purpose of this is to create a coastline that will erode away instead of the actual coastline. 

Sea levels have risen more than 80m since the last ice age. Meltwater from continental ice sheets results in a lot of sediment being introduced into the ocean. That results in higher rates of erosion(more sediment -> more stuff to erode with). 
3.2mm/yr sea level rise from 1.8mm/yr. 
# Estuaries
Estuaries are enclosed bodies of waters with a river at one end and an ocean at the other. An example of an estuary is the Chesapeake Bay. Note that an estuary has a head and a mouth. The head is where it meets the river, and the mouth is where it meets the ocean. 
Weak river-discharge and turbulent mixing estuaries are called **well-mixed**. Uniform water properties with depth. From river head to mouth, salinity increases semi-linearly. 
Strong river-discharge and weak mixing estuaries are called **salt-wedges**. Important property is that the bottom tends to be really salty, whereas the top parts are less salty. Fresh out-flow near the surface and salty inflow near the bottom. Coriolis force can have some effect in these types of estuaries: righthand flow in the NH and lefthand flow in the SH. 
![[Pasted image 20241107214523.png]]
Note that **anoxic** means a lack of oxygen. 
In extreme cases such as the Black Sea, a salt wedge estuary with extremely salty bottom water, there is a lack of mixing between the upper and bottom layers due to a steep difference in salinity, meaning that the bottom water is unventilated and has no input of oxygen. 
## Reverse Estuaries
Evaporation exceeds the combination of precipitation and river discharge. Water levels decrease whereas salt content stays the same/increases. This means that the water becomes saltier over time. Very salty water from the estuary flows out at the bottom while less salty water flows in at the top. Opposite of salt-wedge that has salty inflow at bottom and un-salty outflow at top. 
## Barrier-built
Form behind barrier islands(deposition). 
New Jersey, New York, North/South Carolina, & Texas
## Tectonic
Uplift. Crack in earth->water flows in to fill the basin. 
California
## Glacial
Carved out by glaciers. Also called fjord-types. 
Rhode Island, Washington State, Maine, Canada, Norway
## Drowned River Valley
Rising sea levels flood existing river valleys. 
Delaware, Maryland, Mississippi, Brazil

Remember to consider mass conservation. Generally, the inflow and outflow are the same. Treat precipitation/evaporation as cancelling out. Thus, amount of water flowing in equals amount of water leaving. 
## Nutrient Sources
Bay: Atmospheric, Agriculture, and Urban/Suburban 3 way split. 
Gulf of Mexico: Mainly agriculture, much less Urban/Suburban and a bit of pasture. 
Note that excessive nutrients usually lead to harmful algae blooms(HAB). They absorb sunlight and natural resources from the environment, and make it difficult for other organisms to survive in that environment. Particularly the overconsumption of oxygen and mass production of carbon dioxide. 
Usually, shellfish such as oysters filter out nutrients. However, overfishing -> less shellfish and anthropogenic sources increase, resulting in more and more HABs. Potential solutions include seeding more shellfish and cutting down on anthropogenic production. Restrictions are typically placed on the amount of nutrient runoff that is allowed. 
20% of the Bay is hypoxic and 8% is anoxic. 
# Pollution
Linear population increase, exponential plastic increase. 
14 million tons per year going into the ocean. 
$400*10^9$ kg/yr global production. 
Most plastic settles in the mixed layer. Decreases the lower you go, but also really low ~100 m from the surface. 
Filter-feeding whales ingest large quantities of microplastics. 
Largest producers are China(30%) and then North America(20%). 
First world countries produce much more plastic but a lot more(80%) is deposited on land rather than the ocean. They make up 20% of ocean pollution, which is usually related to the fishing industry. On the other hand, third world countries produce the other 80% of ocean pollution as a result of less plastic being deposited on land. 
# Marine Biology
## Plankton
Ocean viruses make up 94% of all organisms, only 5% of biomass. 
Cyanobacteria produce 30-50% of all photosynthetic production. 
Diatoms are most abundant type of phytoplankton. Around 20% of global production. 
Microzooplankton:
- Dinoflagellates
- Foraminifera
- Ciliate Protozoans
- Radiolaria
- Smaller Larvae
## Fish & Shellfish
### Fish
Typically classified by shape/depth
We have 
- Jawless
	- Lamprey
	- Hagfish
- Cartilaginous
	- Sharks
	- Rays
- Bony
	- Lobe-finned
	- Ray-finned
		- Trout and salmon
- Etc.
More than 30,000 different types. Most are believed to be classified as bony fish, particularly ray-skinned fish rather than lobe-finned fish. Most fish are small and short-lived, although there are many well known exceptions. 
Deeper sea fish are fewer, but also larger. Less resources-> less are able to survive. Slow metabolisms and long life spans-> heavy fishing is extremely damaging. 
### Shellfish
- Mollusks
	- Clams, squid
- Crustaceans
	- Copepods
	- Shrimps
	- Lobsters
## Overfishing
Positive feedback loop: the more a population is overfished, the harder it is to recover. Wild populations are extremely scarce nowadays. However, manmade nurseries/fisheries have led to some fish products such as salmon and cod to have incredibly low prices. Wild-caught is still expensive. Certain techniques, mainly the use of nets, have been limited/restricted due to their effectiveness. Other regions are simply not allowed to be fished in.
