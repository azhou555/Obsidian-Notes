# Chemical and Biological Changes
## Eocene
55-35 Ma (Million years ago)
Deep ocean is acidic and anoxic. Little oxygen, not a lot of plankton, inhospitable. 
Life in the ocean was a lot closer to the surface.
No land ice, so a lot of less land due to higher sea levels. 
Atmospheric CO2 was a lot higher than it is today. 
Very competitive since life was bunched near the surface. 
The ocean was a lot warmer than current times. 
No overturning circulation -> lateral circulation but no mixing between the upper and lower layers. 
$H_{2}O +CO_{2}\leftrightarrow H_{2}CO_{3} \leftrightarrow H^{+}+ HCO_{3}$
Water + CO2, Carbonic acid, H+ and bicarbonate
Even further chemical reactions are possible. However, just know that more water and carbon dioxide results in higher levels of acidity. 
Areas with a lot of rain tend to lower the pH levels(fresh water -> no acidity). 
Surface pH tends to be higher around the subtropical gyres. 
Warmer water -> less oxygen concentration. 
Thus, Eocene had low oxygen concentration.
