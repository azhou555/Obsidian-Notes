5 climate zones in the atmosphere:
1. tropic
2. subtropics
3. midlatitudes
4. subpolar
5. polar
Descending air = deserts
Ascending air = tropics
Rising air at the equator, alternate from their up until descending air in the polar region
Saltiest water is near the subtropics, water is evaporated but the salt doesn't, so it is left behind
Coldest water is about 2$^\circ$C below freezing(freezing point is lowered by salinity).
