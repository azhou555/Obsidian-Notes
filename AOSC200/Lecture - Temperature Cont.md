### Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate
As an air parcel rises, it expands into lower pressure air. As it expands, all of the energy inside is spread out over a larger volume so the temperature drops. As a bubble of air rises, it increases in volume but the temperature drops since the energy is spread out more. If there is no interaction between the air inside the parcel and the outside environment, then the process is said to be adiabatic. 
Dry adiabatic lapse rate -> how temperature drops when height increases for dry air. $10^{\circ}$ C per km. 
However, parcels will rarely stay dry and actually abide to this lapse rate. 
Air parcels will rise until they reach the same temperature as what it around them. 
## Mountains
As air rises up a mountain side, it will cool at the dry adiabatic rate. 
Once it reaches saturation, it cools at the saturated lapse rate. Also, precipitation(rain or nsow) falls out of the cloud and the vapor pressure decreases. 
Rain shadow - dry air opposite to wet air warms as it comes down a mountain and blows across an area. One side(windward) of the mountain is lush and tropical, other side is dry. 
## Proxy Measurements
### Glacier Records
Take samples of old glaciers. More heavy oxygen isotopes = colder temperatures, less heavy oxygen = hotter temperatures
### Pollen Records
Every species of plant has a different pollen. 
### Ice Core Records
Inner parts of glaciers are older, preserved oxygen from long time ago
