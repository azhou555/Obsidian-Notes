### Meteograms
Circle's represent whether or not it is overcast, full circle is overcast. 
Many measurements such as wind and temperature are taken at around 2m, away from the ground but not too high up. 
However, data higher up than just the surface is also necessary -> sending radiosondes up. 
1. Analyzes how weather changes at different heights
2. Analyzing chances of storms
3. Plots Dew Point, Temperature, wind, etc. at different heights
### General Info
Wind is slower at the ground because there is more friction: buildings, ground, trees, etc. 
If dew point intersects with temperature, it is likely to rain. 
Most of the wind is westerlies -> heading west. 
Wind arrows -> The more lines, the faster the wind speed
Temperature generally follows a pattern of getting colder, then getting warmer, cooling off, and then getting hotter again
In troposphere, it generally gets colder the higher we go, and then once we reach the stratosphere it gets warmer. 
Ozone layer absorbs UV rays from the sun: between troposphere and stratosphere. Hence, everything above it contains most of the heat from the sun. 
As temperature goes down, humidity goes up. 
### Weather Maps
Basic Weather Station Model(Left to right, top to bottom):
1. Significant weather
2. Temperature
3. Dew Point temperature
4. Wind speed and direction(arrow, in knots)
	1. Triangle is 50
	2. Barb is 10
	3. Half barb is 5
5. Atmospheric pressure(hPa or mb) 
	1. Should be about 1000-ish(1013 to be precise)
6. Cloud Cover
90 degrees of latitude from Equator to North/South Pole
1 minute of latitude per hour

### Temperature Map
Black lines indicate isotherms, lines of constant temperature. 
The closer the lines are, the larger the temperature change. 
Where lines are clumped, it is likely a front. 
### Pressure Map
Lines are called isobars, lines of constant pressure. 
Detect areas of high and low pressure. 
Helps to indicate surface wind speed and direction. 
Numbers are actual pressure. 
Wind typically goes from high air pressure to high air pressure. 
Ridges of high pressure and troughs of low pressure. 
Boundaries where things rapidly change are where storms, extreme weather typically happen
A place that is high pressure is on the ground is likely higher pressure at higher altitudes as well:
the starting point for the pressure will result in needing more or less distance to encompass the same amount of pressure. 
### Upper Level Maps
Isobaric Maps
1. Temperature(C$^{\circ}$)
2. Height of pressure surface
3. Distance needed to travel to reach some pressure
	1. Oftentimes use vertical distance from 500 mb
Pressure decreases by ~10mb for every 100m
Pressure needs to be adjusted in comparison to sea level. 
### Fronts
Cold front: region where cold air is replacing warm air, cold air mass pushes into an area with warmer air. Blue Triangles. 
Warm front: region where warm air is pushing into an area with colder air. Red semi-circles. 
A front is always moving in the direction that their symbols are pointing towards.
