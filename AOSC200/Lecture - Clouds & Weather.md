### Stable Atmosphere
Environmental lapse rate
## Clouds
Stratus: Layers
Cumulus: Heaps or piles
Nimbus: rain
Alto - mid altitude
Cirrus: high altitude
3 types of altitudes -> bare name, alto, and cirrus. 
Example: altostratus, layerey clouds in middle latitudes
On and on, there are more types and classifications that go into greater depth. 
### Light Scattering
Clouds scatter the light, the particles higher up are exposed to more light whereas at the bottom of the cloud, the scattering is much more profound. 

**Cumulus humilis**, "fair weather cumulus". Very fluffy and wide
**Cumulonimbus**, cumulus clouds with rain
