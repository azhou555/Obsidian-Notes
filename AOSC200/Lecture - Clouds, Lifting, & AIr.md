### Orographic Lifting
Air is forced up the side of a mountain and cools as it falls down the other side. Compelling force is from the ground pushing the air up. 
### Convergence
When wind meets from different directions, the air in between has no place but to go up. Imagine squeezing jello or something out of a tube, pushing it from the sides forces it up since it can't go down. 
### Frontal Lifting
Air of different densities, temperature, doesn't mix together. When a mass of warm air and cold air collide, the colder air will slip underneath the warm air, sticking close to the ground, and push the warm air up. 
### Convection
As surface air is warmed by the sun, it becomes less dense and rises
