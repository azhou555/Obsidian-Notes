Climate - set of conditions that prevails in a region over a ~30 year region
- Precipitation
- Temperature
- Wind speed
- Wind direction
- Ocean height
Climate change - systemic changes in the long-term statistics of climate elements, sustained over several decades or longer
- IOW, how average conditions/trends are changing over time/are different from what they were in the past
Past couple of years, warmest years on record, temperatures hotter than average
2.5$^{\circ}$ Fahrenheit warmer in 2023 than 19th century averages
Small temperature changes in the trends lead to large changes overall. 
Poles warm much faster than the equator
Water when it evaporates absorbs energy
Hot air rises, cold air sinks
Water can boil at different temperatures depending on the pressure
