## Energy Transfer
Water vapor can exist even when temperatures are not super hot, water can evaporate when its not boiling, etc. Vapor to ice is deposition, ice to vapor is sublimation. 
### Latent Heat
Latent heat - the heat required to melt or evaporate a substance or the heat given off when something condenses or freezes. 
Ice in the cooler absorbs heat from the drinks -> melts. 
When you sweat, the sweat evaporates and takes heat away from your body. 
If the sweat can't evaporate(air is saturated), no heat is lost. 
### Saturation
Water evaporates and enters dry air
Water vapor hits the surface through collisions and random motion(condensation)
When evaporation and condensation are equal the air is said to be saturated
### Condensation
1. Decrease the air temperature
2. Increase amount of water vapor
	1. Air is too saturated water condenses 
### Vapor Pressure
Actual vapor pressure: the atmospheric pressure due to water
Saturation vapor pressure: the atmospheric pressure if the air was saturated

### Humidity
Relative humidity: holding / how much it cold hold
Absolute humidity: mass of water vapor per volume
Specific humidity: the mass of water vapor per mass of dry air
When temperature equals dew point, water vapor starts to condense and produce water
### Fog
Air in contact with ground cools to the point that water condenses and forms a suspension of tiny water drops. Ground is coldest at night, fog starts at the ground. This is why we usually see fog in the mornings. 
Radiation fog - ground cooling overnight causes water vapor to condense and form fog
Tule fog - radiation fog that happens in a certain area of California
Advection fog - moist air blows over cold surface and cools enough for droplets to form, moving air
Upslope fog - Winds push moist air uphill to an altitude where temperatures are cold enough for condensation to occur
