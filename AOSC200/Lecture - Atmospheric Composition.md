Water during Earth's early time came from frozen comets from the outer belt that crashed and melted, leaving water and nutrients on Earth. 
1. Frozen comets hit Earth
2. Oceans formed
3. CO2 dissolved into water
4. Sea creatures used CO2, water, and sunlight to create carbohydrates
5. Oxygen formation
Permanent gases make up 99.96% of the atmosphere, we have no impact on these. 
1. Nitrogen: ~78%
2. Oxygen: ~21%
3. Argon: ~0.93%
4. Neon
5. Helium
6. Hydrogen
7. Xenon
Variable gases that control the chemistry of the atmosphere, when we speak of climate change and anthropologic effects these gases are the ones that are changing
1. Water vapor
2. Carbon dioxide
3. Methane
4. Nitrous oxide
5. Ozone
6. Particles
7. Chlorofluorocarbons
Ozone absorbs ultraviolet light. 
CO2 stays in the air for ~200 years, and some of it goes into the land and sea
*Ocean Acidification*
CO2 naturally changes over time and according to the seasons -> during autumn, plants start wilting and produce a lot of biomass
Atmospheric Temperature
![[Atmospheric Temperature.png]]
Environmental Lapse Rate:
Temperature decreases 6.5 C every 1km in the troposphere. 
Tropopause, early in stratosphere and upper troposphere, the temperature stays constant and then begins to increase in stratosphere. Temperature inversion as a result of ozone in stratosphere.
Vast majority of the meteorology we are concerned with is in the troposphere. 
Thermosphere is also known as ionosphere -> temperatures are so high that electrons are stripped from the atoms.
