### Tilt, Seasons, and Temperature Trends
- Around spring is when we are closes to the sun. However, during summer our angle to the sun is more direct, hence the higher temperatures
- Places like Greenland with high albedo(snow and ice) reflect a lot of the light that they receive instead of absorbing it -> their temperature is constantly cold and doesn't fluctuate much
- At night, we don't absorb any energy but continue to give off energy. During the day, we receive more than we give -> temperatures raise. Highest temperatures are during the afternoon, coldest temperatures are shortly after sunrise. 
- Solar energy is most intense, solar rays are more focused, than noon
- Daily mean temperature is determined two ways:
	- Average of max and min temperatures of the day
	- Average of 24 hourly temperatures
- Daily temperature range: difference between coldest and warmest hourly temperature
- Monthly mean temperature: average of daily mean for the month
- Annual mean temperature: average of monthly means
- Annual temperature range: difference between coldest monthly mean and warmest monthly mean
### Temperature Specifics
- Conduction heats air near the ground
- Convection heats air higher from the ground
- As sun rises, ground heats up. 
- During the day, ground is hottest and air near the ground is hottest as a result of conduction
- By the same process, during the night the ground is the coldest and so is the air near the ground
- Air temperature at 2m is likely to be different from temperature on/near the ground->snow/ice puddles even though its supposedly above freezing
- Clouds can trap infrared, cloudy areas will be slightly warmer because they are losing less heat. 
- As long as something is receiving more energy than it is losing, it will keep heating up regardless of what the difference is
- Different objects have different heat capacity
- Land heats up faster than water, but water retains heat better
Dry adiabatic lapse rate: ~10$^{\circ}$ C/km
Moist adiabatic lapse rate: ~6$^{\circ}$ C/km
Formula: Temperature at higher altitude - Temperature at lower altitude / Higher altitude - Lower Altitude
Ideal Gas law
$\displaystyle PV = nRT$, $\displaystyle P = NK_bT$, $\displaystyle N = \frac{P}{K_bT}$
