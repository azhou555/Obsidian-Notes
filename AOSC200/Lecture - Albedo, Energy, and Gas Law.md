Albedo - how much light is being reflected from the object. 
Moon only has 6-8% albedo, but it is super bright because everything else in the sky is black + it receives a lot of light from the sun
Venus has high albedo, but large amount of greenhouse gases(carbon dioxide) that traps whatever heat remains
Convection- energy transferred by vertical movement of fluids(air is considered a fluid)
Hot air rises, cold air sinks!
### Ideal gas law:
pressure = density x temperature x constant
density = pressure/(temperature x constant)
The higher the temperature, the lower the density. 

Sun heats the surface, surface heats the air by conduction, a warm air blob forms. 
Hottest air is near the ground. 
Warm air blob rises, and the cooler air sinks to replace where the blob used to be. 
Constantly having cycles of hot air forming, rising, cool air settling in, then forming new hot air. 

Our bodies glow in infrared, we are still radiating heat energy even if it isn't super hot

Solar zenith angle:
- Zenith: point right over our head
- Solar zenith angle is angle between sun and point over your head, respective to you
- When the sun is right overhead, it is 0$^{\circ}$
- High zenith angle -> near sunrise/sundown
- Low zenith angle -> middle of the day, sun is "high" in the sky

Atmosphere scatters the light -> when you're in the shade, light is still coming form other angle. 
Small solar zenith angle is less likely for light to scatter, large solar zenith angle has higher chance for light to scatter
Depending on the season, amount of atmosphere needed to pass through will change. 

Global Energy Balance: 
- Tropical regions receive more energy than they give off
- Non-tropical regions give off more energy than they receive
- Areas of surplus and areas of deficit
