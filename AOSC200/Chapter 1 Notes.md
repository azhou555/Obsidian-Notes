- Law of conservation of energy -> energy is never created or destroyed but transferred between locations or between different forms of energy
## Heat and Temperature
- Atmosphere is a mixture of gases made up of molecules in motion
- heat is the energy associated with molecular motion, or the kinetic energy
- Think of the air in separate small groups called air parcels where all the air in a single parcel are approximately equal and/or similar to each other
- When discussing temperature, it is easier to consider the average kinetic energy of an air parcel rather than on a molecular level
- Faster molecules collide with slower molecules, imparting some kinetic energy to the slower molecules and thus shifting heat from the "hotter" molecules to the "colder" molecules
### Thermometers
- Thermometers measure average kinetic energy
- For instance, a liquid-in-glass thermometer functions by having a glass tube filled with liquid such as alcohol or mercury, and depending on the temperature around the thermometer the liquid will either gain kinetic energy through conduction through the glass and expand to display a higher heat, or contract to a lower heat
- When exposed to the same temperature, a good thermometer should always display the same result, the liquid should respond the same way
- Temperature is typically measured 2m away from the surface in a shaded area with other details to account for external influences such as the ground, or sunlight that might affect the readings
### Temperature Scales
- Water freezes at 0 C, 32 F, and boils at 100 C, 212 F
- Kelvin scale is set up such that absolute zero, or the lowest possible temperature where there is no kinetic energy or molecular motion, is at 0 K
### Radiosondes
- Helium filled balloons go up to 35km in altitude and make measurements, then send the data back down to the surface
## Pressure
- Amount of "bumping" of molecules is referred to as pressure -> More molecules, more collisions, higher pressure
- Ideal gas law pV = nR*T
	- p is pressure
	- V is volume
	- n is number of molecules in volume V
	- T is temperature
	- R* is a universal constant for gas
- p = dRT
	- d is density
	- R  is a gas constant specific to atmosphere
	- Used for atmosphere
- F = p x A
	- p is pressure applied to surface of area A
	- F is the resulting force
- p = F/A
	- Think of pressure as the force applied to a surface divided by the area of the surface
- Gravity pulls air downward, keeping the atmosphere around Earth and maintaining that there is pressure
- Atmospheric pressure can be the thought of as the accumulated pressure of the column of air stretching from the outward edge of the atmosphere to the surface
- The closer to the surface, the more the air pressure/atmospheric pressure decreases
### Barometers
- An instrument that measures atmospheric pressure is called a barometer
- Mercury barometers are a glass tube filled with mercury and set up such that atmospheric pressure pushing down on the bottom of the barometer forces the mercury to rise higher in the glass tube
- Mercury is needed to balance the weight of the atmosphere -> depending on how much mercury is needed, scientists can observe what the pressure is
- Aneroid barometers are partial chambers that expand and contract, and are connected to a moving needle to detect atmospheric pressure
	- Higher pressure contracts the chamber, lower pressure expands it
### Pressure Units
- Pressure is expressed in pascals where 1 Pa = 1 N / m^2 (one newton per square meter)
	- Oftentimes will be seen using kPa or kilopascal
- psi, or pounds per square inch, is another reasonable metric as well as kilograms per square centimeter where you can consider the pounds as all the air above in the column, whereas the square inch represents the area of the column
- Average atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 atmosphere or one bar
	- 1 b = 1000 mb
	- 1 b = 100 kPa = 1000 hPa
	- 1 mb = 1 hPa
- Average pressure at sea level is approximately 1013 hPa = 1013 mb = 760 mmHg = 29.92 Hg = 14.6 psi'
- Typically, sea level pressure will range from 980 to 1030 hPa, only dropping below 980 hPa during large storms and rising above 1030 hPa during extremely high pressure events
![[Heights and Atmospheric Pressure.png]]
- Note that 250 hPa is the top of troposphere at around 11km above sea level, and also the first layer of the atmosphere where most of the weather takes place and also where 75% of the mass of the atmosphere is contained., as well as where the jet stream is found
### Wind
- Air motion is constrained by the law of conservation of momentum
	- Momentum is product of mass and velocity
	- Wind velocity has both direction and magnitude, which needs to be measured
- Wind direction is measured using a wind vane that simply points to where the wind is coming from
- Wind speed is measured with an anemometer such as a cup anemometer: as the cups catch the wind, a spindle rotates and the rate of rotation of the spindle corresponds to the wind speed
- A common unit used by meteorologists is knots rather than mph or kmh because sailors were the first ones to quantitively measure wind velocity
- 1 knot is one nautical mile per hour =~1.85 km/h ~ 1.15 mph ~ 0.5 m/s
- Beaufort wind scale used by mariners
![[Beaufort Wind Scale.png]]
- Wind tends to stop and start at intervals, creating gusts of wind
- Unpredictability is caused by turbulent eddies that mix air up and down, bringing higher wind speeds down to the surface at times and resulting in strong gusts that can reach up to 20 knots
- Wind is measured 10m above the ground to account for turbulent eddies
- However, wind is still very unpredictable, which results in wind measurements typically being the average wind speed over a period of time, and also split up between sustained wind ~ 1 minute and gusts, which will have different readings
- Commercial aircraft and satellites also gather information
### Precipitation
- Measured using rain gauge
	- Tipping bucket, water is collected by a funnel and falls onto a tipping plate
		- 1 tip ~ 0.25 mm (0.01 inches) of rain
	- Funnel collects raindrops and magnifies rain accumulation into thinner cylinder in order to be read
		- Can only measure accumulated precipitation
- Less than 0.2mm of precipitation is called a trace
### Data Collection
- Automated Weather Observing Systems(AWOS) are set up and collect information such as precipitation, wind velocity, air circulation, etc.
- Buoys in the ocean are also used to measure information out at sea
	- Anchored to sea floor, and are difficult to set up
