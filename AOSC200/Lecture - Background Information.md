Weather is the conditions of the atmosphere at a specific place over shorter time periods. 
Collection of measurable aspects such as precipitation, temperature, type of precipitation, wind speed, wind direction, pressure. 
In other words, collective observations that describe the STATE of the atmosphere. 
Large part of budget because:
- Good to be prepared
	- Road conditions, need to bring umbrella/coat
- Limit risk to lives and property
	- Snowy conditions are dangerous for drivers: schools/businesses need to be closed
	- Do people need to seek shelter
Air of different temperatures don't like to mix together: Occluded front happens when two air masses of vastly different temperatures meet and they kind of shift over each other. 
**Weather Map**:
Blue triangles represent a cold front, red semicircles represent a warm front. 
The two combined represent an occluded front. 
Wherever the shapes are pointing to represent where the air is moving. 
Each dot of number represents the temperature and dew point. 
If temperature and dew point are equal, air is probably saturated and is likely to be raining. 
Arrows represents wind currents and associated details represent how fast it is. 
Part of the process is taking complex weather maps and condensing it into a readable and convenient picture. 
Dry air is more susceptible to large changes in temperature
Weather forecasts are important in order to prepare in advance for issues
Climate is aggregate averages over time. Climate change is the change in these averages -> it becomes political.
