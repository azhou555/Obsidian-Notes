## Climate Change 
Know what is climate change versus weather(long term versus short term). 
Example: wildfires might be more common as a result of climate change, but a single wildfire in isolation is not proof or cause for climate change. 
In the history of our climate, it has been colder, warmer, etc. Our climate is constantly changing. The carbon we are burning for fuel that is causing all the problems, is the same carbon that existed millions of years ago when there was no ice on Earth and it was much warmer. However, our current warming is due to anthropogenic causes and at a much faster pace than what has been observed naturally. 
*Balance of Energy coming in versus energy coming out*
The more energy that stays trapped inside our atmosphere, the hotter we get. If our input doesn't match our output, things start to change. 
### Seasons
Depending on the season, the sun will be higher/lower in the sky and we might receive more scattered or less scattered light. 
Sunlight will become more intense, and we also get more hours of sunlight. 
During winter, the angle of the light hitting the surface of the earth is very extreme, meaning that a beam of light has to get through more atmosphere in order to reach the surface. As a result, the fraction of 
### Greenhouse Gases

2. Carbon Dioxide(CO2)
3. Methane
4. Nitrous Oxide
Trap outgoing longwave, terrestrial radiation. 
#### Vapor Pressure
**Atmospheric pressure** due to water -> small water molecules in the air pressing down
**Saturation vapor pressure**: the atmospheric pressure if the air was saturated
#### Stable vs Unstable
**Unstable** parcels of air are trying to rise: stay warmer than the air around it. 
In an unstable environment, environmental lapse rate is greater than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. In such a situation, the parcel of air will consistently cool at a slower rate than the environment around it, and thus will maintain a higher temperature and continue to rise.
**Stable** parcels are trying to go to the ground or stay at current altitude: same temperature or lower temperature than surrounding air. 
In a stable environment, environmental lapse rate is less than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. 
#### Lapse Rate
Adiabatic describes a lack of interaction between the air within a parcel and its surrounding environment. 
Saturated adiabatic lapse rate is slower than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. 
Dry parcels of air cool quicker than wet ones. 
Dy adiabatic lapse rate : air cools 10$^{\circ}$ C per kilometer. 
Saturated adiabatic lapse rate: air cools 6.5$^{\circ}$ C per kilometer
*Example*
As dry air rises up a mountainside, it cools at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Once it reaches saturation, it will start to cool at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate. Precipitation will fall out of the cloud and the vapor pressure decreases. While going down the mountain, since it has lost so much moisture, it will just continuously heat up at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Thus, the final ending temperature of the parcel of air is warmer than what it started as. 
#### Chinook Winds
**Chinook Arch** cloud term
Chinook winds are the result of orographic lifting and rain shadows. Air heats up rapidly as it rises up and down a mountain. Sometimes can be referred to as a snow eater because the high temperature change will melt snow straight into vapor. 
#### Gravity Waves
Rippling in the air as a result of gravity. With orographic lifting, the contrast between air rising up the mountain and then falling down the mountain causes ripples in the surrounding air
##### Eddies
Just think of same process, air rising, and then strange shapes being formed in the air. 
#### Mean Sea Level Pressure
Changes in altitude naturally result in a difference in pressure. When making graphs, make sure to convert to mean sea level pressure (~10mb decrease per 100m) in order to maintain consistency and avoid assuming there are low pressure systems on high altitude regions. 
#### Solar Cycle
Occurs every 11 years, a single cycle is 11 years. 
The Sun's magnetic field completely flips, such that the north pole becomes south and vice versa. Sunspots are the dots/nonconformities on the surface of the Sun. After each cycle starts, sun spots increase and peak in the middle of the cycle before lowering again before ending once cycle and starting the next. During the middle, solar flares and temperatures increase in intensity and frequency. 
### Daily Cycle
The hottest temperatures during the day occur just after noon. Although noon is when the solar zenith angle is the smallest and the surface is receiving the most direct sunlight, the surface temperatures will continue to heat up as long as the input of solar radiation energy is greater than the terrestrial output. Thus, for a while after noon, the temperatures will continue to heat up. Similarly, the coldest time during the day is a bit after sunrise because temperatures will continue to drop even after the sun has appeared, up until the solar input is greater than the terrestrial output. 
During the day, the surface and the air right above the surface heat up much faster than the air above. During the night, the surface and air right above loses heat much faster than the air above. 
### Latitude
Variations in latitude affect how much temperatures change over the course of a year. Places near the equator have more stable temperatures, whereas higher latitudes result in larger changes. 
### Water?
Places near bodies of water heat up slower but also retain heat better than land. Thus, cities on the coast are typically warmer during winter months, and not as hot during the summer months compared to places of the same latitude that are landlocked. 
- Water has a higher **specific heat**: needs more energy to heat it up the same amount
- Water also mixes heat downward deeper into the ocean->spreads the energy out
- Solare energy pierces deeper into water than land, same as above
- Solar energy is more prone to evaporating the water than heating it up
### Latent Heat
The amount of heat energy required to heat something up, to melt or evaporate a substance. 
When ice melts, it consumes latent heat. Think of ice cubes in a bottle. In order to mitigate the warming of the water, the ice cubes will consume the heat energy and use it to transform into water. Thus, the temperature of the water in the bottle will stay relatively constant, whereas the ice cubes will melt. 
Conversely, when water freezes or condenses it releases latent heat back out. 
Thus, when water condenses to form a cloud, it releases latent heat. Clouds can then warm the air inside of the cloud. 
### Saturation
When evaporation and condensation are equal, air is saturated
##### Saturation vapor pressure
The atmospheric pressure if the air was saturated
### Humidity
Absolute humidity: the mass of water vapor per volume. Standard density sort of thing. 
Specific humidity: the mass of water vapor per mass of dry air
Relative humidity: percent of water vapor present in air compared to the maximum at saturation: $\displaystyle \frac{e}{e_{{s}}}$. 
Temperature and relative humidity are anti-correlated, inverse relationship. If the absolute humidity stays the same, the higher the temperature the more water vapor can be held during saturation. Thus, relative humidity goes down. 
### Dew Point/Frost Point
Dew point is temperature needed for relative humidity to be at 100%. It can also be referred to as the frost point when the temp is below $0^{\circ}$ C, because frost forms rather than dew. 
## Lifting Mechanisms
### Orographic Lifting
Mountains or other high obstacles act as barriers to the flow of air. The parcels of air will attempt to pass through the mountain and force themselves into the mountain, pushing themselves up in the process. 
![[Orographic Lifting.png]]
When air reaches the leeward side(as opposed to the windward side), it loses a lot of moisture in the process(temperature of air parcel cools, pushes out moisture in the form of rain). Thus, the air that pushes over to the other side of the mountain is very dry. Hence, many deserts occur in the proximity of mountains, the air loses its moisture on its path up the mountain and lead to a **rain shadow**(term for the lack of moisture from orographic lifting). 
### Convection
### Convergence
### Updraft
### Frontal Lifting
#### How are clouds formed?
Parcels of air rise and cool until they reach the point of saturation, at which point they form clouds. 
## Clouds
Clouds play an important role in maintaining the temperature of the surface/surface region. During the day, the high albedo of the clouds reflects light away from the surface such that it is cooler. During the night, it prevents infrared radiation(IR) from escaping into the atmosphere. 
### Development
**Subsidence**: the opposite of lifting, a downward force. Subsidence inhibits the formation of clouds. Clouds need upward motion(lifting) and moisture in order to form. If either of those are missing, clouds will not form. 
#### Orographic
Air is forced up a mountain and cools as it rises. Air becomes saturated, water particles begin to form->cloud. 
#### Convergence
Wind meets from different directions, are forced to go up. When the leading edge of the wind slows down, the wind behind it begins to pile up. 
#### Frontal Lifting
Warm air rides up over cold air 
#### Convection
Surface air is warmed up by sun, cloud becomes warmer and rises. 
### Altitudes
#### None
#### Alto

#### Cirrus

### Types
#### Stratus
Layers
#### Cumulus
Heaps or piles, fluffy
#### Nimbus
Raining

When they hit the **tropopause**, they flatten out(anvil tops). 

### Light Scattering
Clouds scatter the light, the particles higher up are exposed to more light whereas at the bottom of the cloud, the scattering is much more profound. The top of clouds look really bright as a result since less light has been scattered, whereas below it looks much darker since much light has been scattered. 

### Atmospheric Window
Wavelength where surface radiation is not absorbed by the atmosphere and is transmitted directly into space

## Fog
### Radiation Fog
Surface cools as heat radiates away to space. 
Air close to the ground cools as a result, forcing the temperature closer to the **dew point** and past it such that mater molecules start to form in the air. 
Typically calm air, not much weather
### Valley Fog
Radiation Fog but in a valley instead
### Advection Fog
Warm, moist, air blows over a cold surface(land or water) and the surface cools the air enough for droplets to start to form. Temperatures drop->likely to reach the dew point and thus saturation. 
### Upslope Fog
Wind push moist air uphill to an altitude where temperatures are cold enough for condensation to occur. 
**Orographic Lifting**
Typically occurs near mountains or large hills(slopes), **orographic lifting** is the mechanism behind why air is being pushed up a hill. 
## Measurements 
1 hPa = 1 mb
1 Pa = 100 mb
#### Thermometers
- Thermometers measure average kinetic energy
- For instance, a liquid-in-glass thermometer functions by having a glass tube filled with liquid such as alcohol or mercury, and depending on the temperature around the thermometer the liquid will either gain kinetic energy through conduction through the glass and expand to display a higher heat, or contract to a lower heat
- When exposed to the same temperature, a good thermometer should always display the same result, the liquid should respond the same way
- Temperature is typically measured 2m away from the surface in a shaded area with other details to account for external influences such as the ground, or sunlight that might affect the readings
#### Temperature Scales
- Water freezes at 0 C, 32 F, and boils at 100 C, 212 F
- Kelvin scale is set up such that absolute zero, or the lowest possible temperature where there is no kinetic energy or molecular motion, is at 0 K
#### Radiosondes
- Helium filled balloons go up to 35km in altitude and make measurements, then send the data back down to the surface
#### Barometers
- An instrument that measures atmospheric pressure is called a barometer
- Mercury barometers are a glass tube filled with mercury and set up such that atmospheric pressure pushing down on the bottom of the barometer forces the mercury to rise higher in the glass tube
- Mercury is needed to balance the weight of the atmosphere -> depending on how much mercury is needed, scientists can observe what the pressure is
- Aneroid barometers are partial chambers that expand and contract, and are connected to a moving needle to detect atmospheric pressure
	- Higher pressure contracts the chamber, lower pressure expands it
#### Rain Gauge
#### Radar
Radar is most commonly used as a means of detecting precipitation. Radar waves are sent out, and will reflect back upon contact with particles in the air(precipitation). 
1. More precipitation results in more reflected radar signals. 
2. By mapping out the time it took for a signal to travel, hit a rain particle, and return, we can estimate distance from the particle and thus estimate the intensity and distance covered by the rain. 
3. By tilting the radar up and down, we can map out the vertical structure of the precipitation as well. 
4. By aggregating networks of radars, things such as a cyclone can be found and mapped out. 
#### Doppler Radar
More advanced radars can also detect the shift in frequency by the returning signal, which can be used to calculate the lateral movements of the raindrops and thus which direction the winding is blowing: by which way the raindrops are moving. 
More modern radars now use both horizontal and vertical radar signals to fully map out the shape of the raindrops. 
### Automated Weather Observing Systems(AWOS)
![[Locations of Weather Measuring Stations.png]]
#### Pressure Units
- Pressure is expressed in pascals where 1 Pa = 1 N / m^2 (one newton per square meter)
	- Oftentimes will be seen using kPa or kilopascal
- psi, or pounds per square inch, is another reasonable metric as well as kilograms per square centimeter where you can consider the pounds as all the air above in the column, whereas the square inch represents the area of the column
- Average atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 atmosphere or one bar
	- 1 b = 1000 mb
	- 1 b = 100 kPa = 1000 hPa
	- 1 mb = 1 hPa
- Average pressure at sea level is approximately 1013 hPa = 1013 mb = 760 mmHg = 29.92 Hg = 14.6 psi'
- Typically, sea level pressure will range from 980 to 1030 hPa, only dropping below 980 hPa during large storms and rising above 1030 hPa during extremely high pressure events

### Measurements by Proxy
##### Tree Rings
Measure carbon traces in between rings of trees, detect what the climate was like
##### Pollen Records
Pollen is unique for each plant, carbon dating can tell us how old pollen is and looking at what plant the pollen belongs to can tell us what plants thrived at certain periods: what the climate might have been like. 
##### Ice Cores
Take ice samples from glaciers, analyze carbon isotopes and judge climate based on heaviness of isotopes. 
###### Carbon Isotopes
Same protons, different number of neutrons. Heavier isotopes have more neutrons, indicate that 

### Reading Weather Maps
#### Highs, Lows, Ridges, and Troughs
A ridge is a general line drawn across an area where the region below the line is cooler than the area above. Note that a ridge is curved upward. 
Conversely, a trough is where the temperature below is warmer than above, and curves facing downward. 
Note that they may be referred to as ridges of high pressure and/or troughs of low pressure. 
#### Upper Level Maps
Upper level maps portray what height a certain pressure. Think level curves. The x axis is a displacement in some direction, and the y axis is height. Lines are drawn on the graph, one for each pressure. Other maps are like a squiggly cross section similar to a surface level map. However, whereas a surface level map uses altitude as the control and pressure as the variable, a upper level map might rather use pressure as the control and altitude as the variable. Note that some common pressures used are  850, 500, and 300 hPa. 
Note that ridges and troughs can also be observed on upper level maps, similarly to that in a standard surface level map. You might also see maps where wind is the variable rather than altitude. 


## Heat and Temperature
- Atmosphere is a mixture of gases made up of molecules in motion
- heat is the energy associated with molecular motion, or the kinetic energy
- Think of the air in separate small groups called air parcels where all the air in a single parcel are approximately equal and/or similar to each other
- When discussing temperature, it is easier to consider the average kinetic energy of an air parcel rather than on a molecular level
- Faster molecules collide with slower molecules, imparting some kinetic energy to the slower molecules and thus shifting heat from the "hotter" molecules to the "colder" molecules
### Latitude Variations
Smaller temperature changes across a year indicate proximity to the equator. The more drastic the changes are, the higher the latitude is likely to be. 
### Solar Zenith Angle
The SZA is the angle between the sun, you, and your zenith(position directly above you). 
During spring, higher SZA. Daytime, also higher SZA. 
### Temperature Trends
![[Lecture - Temperature Trends]]
## Pressure
- Amount of "bumping" of molecules is referred to as pressure -> More molecules, more collisions, higher pressure
- Ideal gas law pV = nR*T
	- p is pressure
	- V is volume
	- n is number of molecules in volume V
	- T is temperature
	- R* is a universal constant for gas
- p = dRT
	- d is density
	- R  is a gas constant specific to atmosphere
	- Used for atmosphere
- F = p x A
	- p is pressure applied to surface of area A
	- F is the resulting force
- p = F/A
	- Think of pressure as the force applied to a surface divided by the area of the surface
- Gravity pulls air downward, keeping the atmosphere around Earth and maintaining that there is pressure
- Atmospheric pressure can be the thought of as the accumulated pressure of the column of air stretching from the outward edge of the atmosphere to the surface
- The closer to the surface, the more the air pressure/atmospheric pressure decreases
![[Heights and Atmospheric Pressure.png]]
- Note that 250 hPa is the top of troposphere at around 11km above sea level, and also the first layer of the atmosphere where most of the weather takes place and also where 75% of the mass of the atmosphere is contained., as well as where the jet stream is found
## Wind
- Air motion is constrained by the law of conservation of momentum
	- Momentum is product of mass and velocity
	- Wind velocity has both direction and magnitude, which needs to be measured
- Wind direction is measured using a wind vane that simply points to where the wind is coming from
- Wind speed is measured with an anemometer such as a cup anemometer: as the cups catch the wind, a spindle rotates and the rate of rotation of the spindle corresponds to the wind speed
- A common unit used by meteorologists is knots rather than mph or kmh because sailors were the first ones to quantitively measure wind velocity
- 1 knot is one nautical mile per hour = 1.85 km/h = 1.15 mph = 0.5 m/s
- Beaufort wind scale used by mariners
[[Beaufort Wind Scale.png]]
- Wind tends to stop and start at intervals, creating gusts of wind
- Unpredictability is caused by turbulent eddies that mix air up and down, bringing higher wind speeds down to the surface at times and resulting in strong gusts that can reach up to 20 knots
- Wind is measured 10m above the ground to account for turbulent eddies
- However, wind is still very unpredictable, which results in wind measurements typically being the average wind speed over a period of time, and also split up between sustained wind ~ 1 minute and gusts, which will have different readings
- Commercial aircraft and satellites also gather information
## Feedback Mechanisms
### Positive Feedback Loops
#### Ice-Albedo Feedback
Temperature rises, ice melts. The more ice that melts, the lower the overall albedo of the planet is. Less light is reflected and instead absorbed, as a result. The more light that is absorbed, the more temperatures rise. 
### Negative Feedback Loops
#### CO2 Feedback and Plants
Humans release CO2, surface temperature rises, plants grow better due to more CO2. 
More plants -> more plant consumption of CO2, which leads to a decrease in CO2
