# Precipitation
## Rain Formation
#### Collision and Coalescence
Bigger drops collect smaller drops as they move through the cloud, as they grow larger they eventually start to fall down as a result of gravity. Big drops can also collide with other drops and clump together. 
## Types of precipitation
1. Rain
	1. Frozen precipitation melts into rain
2. Freezing Rain
	1. Frozen precipitation melts in warm air, then falls and freezes on cold surfaces such as a sheet of ice
3. Sleet
	1. Frozen precipitation melts and then refreezes before hitting the ground
4. Snow
	1. Doesn't melt
# Clouds
## Sections of a cloud
Below $-40^{\circ}C$, we get ice crystals. Between $0^{\circ}$ and $-40^{\circ}C$, its mix. Above $0$, we get liquid droplets. 
## Bergeron Process
Ice crystals grow 
## Accretion and Aggregation
Falling ice crystals freeze supercooled droplets upon contact, the ice crystal will grow as a result. 
Ice crystals collide with each other and stick to each other. When you see really big snowflakes, likely due to aggregation. 
## Hail
Layers of ice form on hailstone, eventually begin to start falling in a downdraft that results in precipitation. 
## Ice crystal habits
There are a lot of different types of snowflakes and ice crystals. Dendrites are a type of plate, and the most well known. Shape of ice crystals are dependent on temperature and supersaturation. 
# Pressure
## Pressure Gradient Force
Strong PGF->Strong wind
Weak PGF->Weak wind
Goes from high pressure areas towards low pressure areas. 
## Coriolis Force
Deflection force as air travels around the globe. Minimal at equator, strongest at poles. The stronger the other forces, the stronger the Coriolis force. 
## Geostrophic Wind
When PGF and Coriolis force are at a perfect balance, the wind flows parallel to isobars(geostrophic balance). This only really happens far away from the surface with no friction. 
## Centrifugal Force
Points outward and depends on wind speed. Can combine with PGF or Coriolis force depending on the motion. 
## Friction
Surface winds are typically going to be slower than higher level winds as a result of the presence of friction. 
**Winds spin CCW inward around a low and CW outward around a high in the northern hemisphere**. In the southern hemisphere, just reverse it. 
Air rises at a low pressure center and sinks at a high pressure zone. 
# Cell Models
## Single Cell Model
Low at the equator and high at the poles. Doesn't account for mid-latitude westerlies. 
## Three Cell Model
Easterly low latitude trade winds. Mid latitude westerlies. Polar easterlies. Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cell. Rising at equator, sinking at $30^{\circ}$, rising at $60^{\circ}$, and then sinking again at the poles. 
## Intertropical Convergence Zone
ITCZ, colliding air at the equator that rises leads to precipitation and heavy cloudiness. 
## Jet Streams
Located where two cells meet. We have the Polar jet and Subtropical jet. Go to the east. 
## Ekman Transport
Winds drive ocean currents. Push waters to the right in northern hemisphere(coriolis force). 
## El Nino / La Nina
Equatorial trade winds get weak, stagnant air heats up and heats up the water. La Nina is the opposite.
