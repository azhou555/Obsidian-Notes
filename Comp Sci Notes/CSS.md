## Common CSS Measurement Units🐱

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit** | **Name** | **Type** | **Equals** |
| px  | pixel | Absolute | 1/96 of an inch |
| pt  | point | Absolute | 1/72 of an inch |
| em  | em  | Relative | The elements default, inherited, or defined font size |
| rem | root em | Relative | The font size of the root element of the web page |
| vw  | viewport width | Relative | 1/100 of the current width of the browser's content area |
| vh  | viewport height | Relative | 1/100 of the current height of the browser's viewport area |

### Relative vs Absolute🐝

An absolute measurement unit doesn't change regardless of external settings and will remain the same everywhere. Relative units on the other hand have a baseline of sorts that will impact the size displayed. Taking em for example, if the page's default size is 16px, then a piece of text with size 2em will display 32px. However, if a user instead had a default size of 25px rather than 16px, then the same piece of text would then be displayed as size 50px for them. It is important to note that the em takes the default value of whatever container it is stored in. Take this as an example.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>em Rules</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        This is size 16px
            <p style="font-size: 2em;">
                This is 32px
                <p style="font-size: 2em;">
                    This is 64px
                </p>
            </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Font Family 🦑

Font can make a large difference in the appearance of your websites. However, HTML itself provides a limited number of font including serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, and monospace.

However, you also have access to system fonts including Verdana, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Georgia, and others that are installed universally. One way of implementing this is to simply list out different fonts, and the system will use whichever one works first:
```
font-family: "Gill Sans", Calibri, Verdana, sans-serif;
```
Another option is to use a font provided by Google. To do so, go to <https://fonts.google.com>, find a desired font, copy the <link> tag generated by the site and paste it in the html file somewhere within the <head> tag. Make sure to link the file in prior to the <section> or the link to the CSS <link> tag. Alternatively, you can download the font family and add it to the root directory.

## Coloring🎨

### Specifying a Color

There are several ways of specifying a specific color, but 3 main ones are typically used:

* Color Keyword
	* red, green yellow, etc
	* Notably also contains less known and used colors such as peachpuff, lemonchiffon, etc
* RGB()
	* rgb() is a built-in CSS function that takes 3 values for red, green, and blue, respectively, between 0 and 255 to produce a color.
	* rgb(255, 218, 185) produces PeachPuff
* RGB code
	* 6 digit RGB code in the form rrggbb produces a color
	* rr is a two digit value specifying the red in the color, gg specifying the green, and bb specifying the blue
	* Each 2 digit code goes from 00 to ff represents 255 in hexadecimal
	* PeachPuff is produced by #ffdab9

Extensive list of color can be found at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color> or <https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/>
We use the color attribute to apply a color to text. The following color styles are identical:
```
color: peachpuff;
color: rgb(255, 218, 185);
color: #ffdab9
```
We can also go as far as to set the background color of an entire page or particular elements through:
```
background-color: peachpuff;
background-color: rgb(255, 218, 185);
background-color: #ffdab9
```
To display something like white text on a black background, we could put this in _style.css_:
```
body {
    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
}
```
Note that it is important to ensure contrast such that a user could read a page but not so much that the contrast would be jarring. Instead of using the above example where the contrast is too stark, use this instead:
```
body {
    color: rgb(222, 222, 222);
    background-color: rgb(32, 32, 32);
}
```
